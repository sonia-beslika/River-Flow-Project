## Project Aims
This is my first independent project and was intended as a learning exercise to practise version control, use an IDE and learn GitHub's features.

If you are a beginner, my Jupyter NoteBook outlines the tasks I completed for each step of the project and the project's [wiki](https://github.com/sonia-beslika/River-Flow-Project/wiki) has more background information on the resources and tools I found helpful.

## Packages & Data

Packages:
```
import pandas as pd       # For data manipulation and analysis
import numpy as np        # For numerical computing
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For static data visualization
import seaborn as sns     # For statistical data visualization
```
Data:
   - **Source**: [National River Flow Archive](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/) (UK)
   - **Usage**: Gauged Daily Glow and Catchment Daily Rainfall for [Bathford Station](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/53018) on the River Avon.
   - **Format**: CSV files downloaded from the National River Flow Archive's website.

## Future Work

- Use linear regressions to build and evaluate a predictive model

- Improve visualizations and explore interactive features through plotly

- Use APIs to update project dataset with most recent observations - this might require choosing a new observation station for my project.
